## 0.9.6

‚ùó indicates a breaking change.

### Added

- Added support for SVG fontsüñãÔ∏èüíª.
- Added support for color emojisüî§üòä.
- Resource bundling has been rewritten from scratch. Apps can now override Brisk resources, such as supplying their own fonts.
- Support for viewport-relative units (vw/vh/vmax/vmin)
- ‚ùó Buffered GUI mode has been introduced. The GUI is rendered to an offscreen texture, tracking the updated rectangles each frame. The texture is then blitted to the screen, significantly improving performance in cases where GUI updates are infrequent. This mode can be switched off for a specific window or globally.
- Lucide icons have been updated to latest version.
- Ability to override `ItemList` visible property.
- `WidgetTree` can now be used without a `GUIWindow` and `InputQueue`.
- New algorithm for shadow rendering by Evan Wallace.
- A new `ColorW` type has been introduced, capable of storing extended-range sRGB values in a compact form.
- `storeWidget` function to store the weak pointer to the widget to an external variable during tree building.
- `string_view` versions of the `trim`, `ltrim` and `rtrim` functions.
- `BRISK_ASSUME` macro that maps to `__builtin_assume` on supported compilers.
- `SVGImage::renderTo` to render to an existing `Image`.
- Resources are now packed into a binary using the `.incbin` assembly instruction on supported compilers for improved performance.
- HTML SAX parser added.
- Very basic HTML support in the `Text` widget via `textOption = TextOptions::HTML`.
- Stateless functions in `Canvas` class.
- Added the ability to select the internationalization implementation: basic or ICU-based. Apps can now choose the implementation without rebuilding the Brisk binaries.
- Visual tests for widgets.

### Changed

- ‚ùó A new implementation of widget clipping has been introduced. Widget painting can now be clipped to the parent's bounds, the parent's clip rectangle, or the widget's own bounds.
- ‚ùó `DialogComponent::result` is now a `Property` instead of a plain field.  
  Use `result.get()` to retrieve the boolean value or rely on implicit conversion.  
  The same applies to the `value`, `prompt`, `text`, and `icon` fields in derived dialogs.
- ‚ùó `buttonColor` has been renamed to `mainColor`.
- ‚ùó The `layoutOptions` property of the `Text` widget has been renamed to `textOptions`, and the `LayoutOptions` type is now `TextOptions`.
- ‚ùó The `createWindow` function should now be overridden instead of `makeWindow` to use a custom window class for the component.
- ‚ùó A new `isHintVisible` property controls whether the widget's hint is visible.  
- ‚ùó The `description` property has been removed in favor of the `hint` property.
- ‚ùó New font size default (12 pixels).
- ‚ùó The `reflection` static field is now used to store field information (previously `Reflection`).
- ‚ùó Style variables (e.g., `selectedColor`) are now indexed by string hash instead of a linear index, making it easier to create custom variables.
- `ComboBox` and `PopupBox` mouse interaction fixes.
- `ImplicitContext` is now convertible to `bool`.
- The descender value of Lucide icons has been adjusted to improve their alignment within text.
- The `Knob` and `Slider` colors can be changed by assigning the `selectedColor` style variable. Hover and pressed styles are preserved.
- `Showcase` app updated.
- The `ReflectionOf` utility class has been introduced to provide reflection information for external types.
- ‚ùó Shell-related functions moved to the `Shell` class: `Shell::showMessage`, `Shell::openURLInBrowser`, `Shell::showDialog`, etc.
- ‚ùó Clipboard-related functions moved to the `Clipboard` class: `Resources::getText`, etc.
- ‚ùó Resource-related functions moved to the `Resources` class: `Resources::load`, etc.
- ‚ùó `InplacePtr` and `PossiblyShared` types are removed.
- ‚ùó `uiThread` has been renamed to `uiScheduler` to match `mainScheduler`.
- ‚ùó `std::optional` and `std::nullopt` are no more included in Brisk namespaces. Use full qualified names instead.
- ‚ùó File IO functions now use `uint64_t` instead of `uintmax_t`.
- ‚ùó Several renames have been made to ensure style consistency (`bytes` ‚Üí `Bytes`, `bytes_view` ‚Üí `BytesView`).
- ‚ùó `Bytes`, `BytesView`, and other related types now use `std::byte` instead of `uint8_t`.
- ‚ùó The lifetime of `BindingObject` is now accessed via the `lifetime` function. Replace occurrences of `m_lifetime` with `lifetime()` in your code.
- ‚ùó Font name constants moved to the `Font` class: `Fonts::Monospace` ‚Üí `Font::Monospace`.
- Documentation files have been updated.
- ‚ùó Fonts are now set by their names, not IDs. Examples: `fontFamily = "Lato"`, `Font{"Noto", 16}`.
- Performance optimizations.
- New `WrapAnywhere` flag in `TextOptions`.
- ‚ùó Aliases to `std` types removed.

### Fixed

- Numerous fixes and improvements.
- `BRISK_SCRIPTS_DIR` is now cached in `CMakeCache.txt`, resolving issues when Brisk is included using `add_subdirectory`.
- `Rectangle::empty` has been fixed to return `true` for `{INT_MAX, INT_MAX, INT_MIN, INT_MIN}`.
- `BackStrikedText` now uses opacity for painting.
- Fixed contrast ratio calculation, ensuring that light text color is preferred on certain backgrounds.
- `findIntegralType` fixes.
- Brisk now supports spaces around commas in the font list ("Lato, Noto").
