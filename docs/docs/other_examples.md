# Brisk examples

See the `examples` directory in the Brisk repository for advanced examples of using the Brisk framework.

### Showcase
`showcase`: A demonstration of most, but not all, Brisk widgets.

### Calculator
`calc`: A simple calculator application built with Brisk.

### Own Window
`own-window`: Demonstrates the use of the Brisk rendering engine to draw on an externally supplied window. This example and the next use the GLFW library to abstract the platform window.

### Own Window GUI
`own-window-gui`: Shows how to utilize Brisk widgets within an externally supplied window.

### WebGPU Demo
`webgpu-demo`: Renders a simple 3D scene using Brisk and WebGPU.

### Splash Screen
`splash-screen`: Demonstrates creating a splash screen with an image and a progress bar displayed during application loading.

### Dashboard
`dashboard`: An application that displays CPU usage per core. It demonstrates the following features:
- Data binding
- Dialog creation (About dialog and Settings dialog)
- Custom widgets
- Menus and actions
- Shortcuts
- File dialogs
- Custom styling
- Application-wide settings

### 7GUIs Tasks

The following examples implement tasks from the 7GUIs benchmark, showcasing Brisk's capabilities in handling common GUI programming challenges:

- `counter`: A simple counter application with a display and an increment button, demonstrating basic state management and event handling in Brisk.
- `timer`: A timer application that tracks elapsed time with start, stop, and reset functionality, showcasing real-time updates and timer logic.
- `temperature_converter`: A bidirectional temperature converter between Celsius and Fahrenheit, illustrating two-way data binding and input validation.
- `flight_booker`: A flight booking interface for selecting one-way or return flights with date validation, demonstrating conditional UI logic and form handling.
- `crud`: A Create-Read-Update-Delete application for managing a list of items, implemented using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to separate data logic from the UI.
