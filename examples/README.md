# Brisk Example Projects

- `showcase`: A demo of most, but not all, Brisk widgets.
- `calc`: A simple calculator built with Brisk.
- `own-window`: Demonstrates how to use the Brisk rendering engine and draw on an externally supplied window. This example and the next one use the GLFW library to abstract the platform window.
- `own-window-gui`: Shows how to use Brisk widgets in an externally supplied window.
- `webgpu-demo`: Renders a simple 3D scene using Brisk and WebGPU.
- `splash-screen`: Demonstrates how to create a splash screen with an image and a progress bar that displays while the application loads.
- `dashboard`: An application that displays CPU usage per core. It demonstrates the following features:
    - Data binding
    - Dialog creation (About dialog and Settings dialog)
    - Custom widgets
    - Menus and actions
    - Shortcuts
    - File dialogs
    - Custom styling
    - Application-wide settings

You are free to modify the code of any example and use it as a starting point for your own projects, whether GPL-licensed or proprietary, depending on the Brisk license you own.

### 7GUIs Tasks

The following examples implement tasks from the 7GUIs benchmark, showcasing Brisk's capabilities in handling common GUI programming challenges:

- `counter`: A simple counter application with a display and an increment button, demonstrating basic state management and event handling in Brisk.
- `timer`: A timer application that tracks elapsed time with start, stop, and reset functionality, showcasing real-time updates and timer logic.
- `temperature_converter`: A bidirectional temperature converter between Celsius and Fahrenheit, illustrating two-way data binding and input validation.
- `flight_booker`: A flight booking interface for selecting one-way or return flights with date validation, demonstrating conditional UI logic and form handling.
- `crud`: A Create-Read-Update-Delete application for managing a list of items, implemented using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to separate data logic from the UI.
