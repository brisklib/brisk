# Brisk Example Projects

- `showcase`: A demo of most, but not all, Brisk widgets.
- `calc`: A simple calculator built with Brisk.
- `own-window`: Demonstrates how to use the Brisk rendering engine and draw on an externally supplied window. This example and the next one use the GLFW library to abstract the platform window.
- `own-window-gui`: Shows how to use Brisk widgets in an externally supplied window.
- `webgpu-demo`: Renders a simple 3D scene using Brisk and WebGPU.
- `splash-screen`: Demonstrates how to create a splash screen with an image and a progress bar that displays while the application loads.

You are free to modify the code of any example and use it as a starting point for your own projects, whether GPL-licensed or proprietary, depending on the Brisk license you own.
